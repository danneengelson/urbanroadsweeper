### Trouble shooting

E: Package 'liblas-dev' has no installation candidate
E: Unable to locate package liblas-c-dev

Download and compile the latest liblas version by following instructions "Using Unix Makefiles on Linux¶" at https://liblas.org/compilation.html

To make "lasinfo" work you might need to run following:
´´´
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
cd las2pcd
cmake .
´´´

To make "make" work you might need to 
1. Change to local in CMakeLists.txt in las2pcd:
/usr/**local**/lib/liblas.so
/usr/**local**/lib/liblas_c.so
2. Run following:
´´´
mv las2pcd /usr/bin/
´´´

## Crop Point clouds
1. Put the urban02.pcd, urban05.pcd and urban17.pcd in the same folder.
2. Run ´´´ sh crop_pcd.sh PATH_TO_FOLDER ´´´
